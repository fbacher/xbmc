//  Purpose:   Unicode oriented string functions
//  Author:    Frank Feuerbacher
//
//  Derived from StringUtils.h, but put in separate class to emphasize
//  both the Unicode orientation as well as to point out that the
//  functions are as close to the original StringUtils functions, but NOT
//  identical. Function name, parameter and behavioral differences exist.
//
//  This class relies heavily on icu4c Unicode library. The Unicode class
//  handles the low level interaction with ICU while this provides the
//  functions which Kodi code should normally use.

/*
 * #define USE_TO_TITLE_FOR_CAPITALIZE controls whether to use legacy Kodi ToCapitalize
 * or to use ICU's TitleCase.
 * ToCapitalize algorithm:
 *   Upper case first letter of every "word"; Punctuation as well as spaces
 *   separates words. "n.y-c you pig" results in "N.Y-C You Pig". No characters
 *   lower cased. Only uppercases first codepoint of word, potentially producing
 *   bad Unicode when multiple codepoints are used to represent a letter.
 *   May be difficult to correct with exposed APIs.
 *
 * TitleCase algorithm:
 *   Imperfect, but uses Locale rules to Title Case. Takes context into account.
 *   Does NOT generally use a dictionary of words to NOT uppercases (i.e. to, the...)
 *   Would titlecase "n.y.c you pig" as "N.y.c You Pig", but "n-y-c" becomes "N-Y-C"
 *   (the same as Capitalize). Behavior can be modified, including adding code to
 *   perform dictionary lookups.
 *
 *   Properly handles any change of string (byte) lengths during the capitalization.
 *
 * Limitations: Uses the current user's locale. Call ToTitle directly to be able
 *   to specify locale.

  /**
   *  A Brief description of some of the Unicode issues:
   *
   *  Working with Unicode and multiple languages greatly complicates
   *  string operations. ToLower prompted the creation of this class. Turkic
   *  has 4 versions of the letter I (two of which are the Roman ones "I"
   *  and "i". A number of languages do something like this and it is not normally
   *  a huge deal. However, in Turkic, changing the case of the Roman "I" (same
   *  as English I) results in the Turkic, lower case dotless I, "ı". This
   *  broke tons of code and prevented Kodi from woking at all in Turkic and
   *  a similar language. Other problems were discovered that were more subtle.
   *
   *  Changing the case of strings can change their byte AND character lengths,
   *  depending upon locale. Example, German sharp-s 'ß' is equivalent to two
   *  lower-case 's' characters. UpperCasing a sharp-s becomes 'SS' because
   *  there is no upper-case sharp-S.
   *
   *  FoldCase is normally what you want to use instead of ToLower (when you
   *  want to 'normalize' a string for use as an index, etc.). (This resolved
   *  the Turkic-I problem mentioned above.)
   *
   *  UTF-8, UTF-16, etc. are all encodings for 4-byte Unicode codepoints.
   *  A codepoint is frequently a 'character' but not necessarily. Codepoints
   *  can represent character variations, such as accent marks. Emojiis are
   *  also included in the Unicode standard. (The flag of Scotland (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿) requires
   *  seven-codepoint sequence)). Unicode frequently uses the terms "character"
   *  and "Grapheme" interchangeably, if not a bit loosely.
   *
   *  In addition to some characters being composed of multiple codepoints, the
   *  order of all but the first codepoint can get scrambled a bit during
   *  processing. They visually look the same (who cares if the left upper dot
   *  is specified before the right upper dot), they can wreak havoc with the
   *  code. To solve this are various Normalizations that can be applied. Fortunately
   *  Normalization is not required in many cases. The only problem is, I haven't
   *  figured out the rules yet. Normalization may be required before & after a
   *  FoldCase operation, for example. When possible, this function does this
   *  for you.
   *
   *  C++ has some rudimentary Unicode support but has gaping holes:
   *  Many g++ systems define wchar_t as unsigned 32 bits, which maps
   *  nicely to a Unicode codepoint. However, the standard does NOT specify
   *  a length for wchar_t. Newer C++ versions adds several new character
   *  types that move in the right direction, but there is no support for
   *  Normalizing, working with multi-codepoint "characters" and many other
   *  capabilities.
   *
   *  Implications of C++ limitations:
   *  * You can't compare two strings one byte or even codepoint at a time
   *  * Two strings of different, non-zero lengths does not tell you if
   *    strings are not-equal! (Not without knowing that the strings are Normalized
   *    for the same locale).
   *  * When iterating the characters of a string, you frequently have
   *    to know where the character boundaries are, which there is no support
   *    for
   *  * You may have to copy or alter strings simply to compare them
   *
   * ICU library
   *  * The ICU library, while complicated and pretty heavy, can reliably
   *    handle many localization and Unicode issues.
   *  * Frequently strings are Normalized. Normalizing isn't that expensive.
   *  * While it is simpler/faster to keep everything in Unicode (32-bit),
   *    it is not overly expensive to use utf-8, utf-16.
   *  * ICU tries to be as efficient as possible, assumes the most common,
   *    cheaper case first, resorting to more expensive solutions only when
   *    needed.
   *
   * The string methods here are definitely more expensive than those in StringUtils.
   * There is a lot of opportunity for improvement:
   *  * This initial release focused more on correct function than speed.
   *    Numerous improvements can be made
   *  * Database Sorting is a good opportunity for improvement. There are
   *    multiple character conversions performed for EACH comparison
   *    (UTF-8? -> wchar (Unicode) -> UTF-16 (ICU native encoding)).
   *    Database encodings are configurable. I don't know how Kodi configures
   *    the databases.
   *  * Many operations use heap memory for temp objects. Can change to
   *    stack allocated memory (requires a bit more boilerplate code)
   *  * For future release, convert everything to one of ICUs preferred
   *    representations and avoid all of the temp conversions.

   *
   * SplitMulti is essentially equivalent to running Split(string, vector<delimiters>, maxstrings) over multiple
   * strings with the same delimiters and returning the aggregate results. Null strings are not returned.
   *
   * There are some significant differences when maxstrings alters the process. Here are the boring details:
   *
   * For each delimiter, Split(string<n> input, delimiter, maxstrings) is called for each input string.
   * The results are appended to results <vector<string>>
   *
   * After a delimiter has been applied to all input strings, the process is repeated with the
   * next delimiter, but this time with the vector<string> input being replaced with the
   * results of the previous pass.
   *
   * If the maxstrings limit is not reached, then, as stated above, the results are similar to
   * running Split(string, vector<delimiters> maxstrings) over multiple strings. But when the limit is reached
   * differences emerge.
   *
   * Before a delimiter is applied to a string a check is made to see if maxstrings is exceeded. If so,
   * then splitting stops and all split string results are returned, including any strings that have not
   * been split by as many delimiters as others, leaving the delimiters in the results.
   *
   * Differences between current behavior and prior versions: Earlier versions removed most empty strings,
   * but a few slipped past. Now, all empty strings are removed. This means not as many empty strings
   * will count against the maxstrings limit. This change should cause no harm since there is no reliable
   * way to correlate a result with an input; they all get thrown in together.
   *
   * If an input vector element is empty the result will be an empty vector element (not
   * an empty string).
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   * Delimiter strings are applied in order, so once iMaxStrings
   * items is produced no other delimiters are applied. This produces different results
   * than applying all delimiters at once:
   *
   * Ex: input = {"a/b#c/d/e/foo/g::h/", "#p/q/r:s/x&extraNarfy"}
   *     delimiters = {"/", "#", ":", "Narf"}
   *     if iMaxStrings=7
   *        return value = {"a", "b#c", "d" "e", "foo", "/g::h/", "p", "q", "/r:s/x&extraNarfy}"
   *
   *     if iMaxStrings=0
   *        return value = {"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "", "h", "", "", "p", "q", "r", "s",
   *                        "x&extra", "y"}
   *
   * e.g. "a/b#c/d" becomes "a", "b#c", "d" rather
   * than "a", "b", "c/d"
   *
   * \param input vector of strings each to be split
   * \param delimiters strings to be used to split the input strings
   * \param iMaxStrings limits number of resulting split strings. A value of 0
